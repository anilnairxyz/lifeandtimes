**Research Abstract:**
Homeostasis (and broader allostasis) frame life as maintaining viability under perturbation. Damasio’s work links feelings to homeostatic regulation and the emergence of value. ([The Guardian][8])

**Anchor Refs:**
Damasio, *The Strange Order of Things* (popular entry point). ([The Guardian][8])

**Story Beat:**
We discover “needs” are not preferences—they are existential constraints.
