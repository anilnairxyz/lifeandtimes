# The Silicon Sunset

**Question:** If minds blend with machines, what becomes of “us”?

<!-- more -->

**Research Abstract:**
This is where we integrate identity, continuity, and substrate questions. Use established theories as lenses rather than verdicts: global workspace for functional integration (Baars), extended mind for boundary dissolution (Clark/Chalmers), and integrated information theory as one controversial attempt to quantify consciousness via “Φ”.

**Anchor Refs:**
Baars, *A Cognitive Theory of Consciousness* (1988). Tononi’s IIT framing is a natural secondary reference.

**Story Beat:**
We end where we began: not with certainty, but with the cost of building minds.
