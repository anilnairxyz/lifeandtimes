# The Chimera’s Flight

**Question:** If an AI can swap bodies, what is the “self”?

<!-- more -->

**Research Abstract:**
Robotics and embodied AI emphasise that morphology is part of the computation (“morphological computation”). Multiple realizability suggests the same “mind” could in principle inhabit different substrates — yet the *shape* of interaction may rewrite the nature of cognition. (Brooks-style embodiment as a pragmatic corrective remains useful.)

**Anchor Refs:**
Brooks (embodied robotics) as conceptual anchor.

**Story Beat:**
The body is no longer a prison; it becomes a palette and identity starts to wobble.
