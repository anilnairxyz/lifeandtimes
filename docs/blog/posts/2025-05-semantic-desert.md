# The Semantic Desert

**Question:** Is symbol manipulation ever sufficient for meaning?

<!-- more -->

**Research Abstract:**
The Chinese Room argues that syntax alone does not yield **intentionality** (aboutness). Regardless of one’s view on Searle’s conclusion, it spotlights the distinction between **formal operations** and **semantic content**.

**Anchor Refs:**
Searle, “Minds, Brains, and Programs” (1980).

**Story Beat:**
We now suspect the machine can produce answers without owning meanings.
