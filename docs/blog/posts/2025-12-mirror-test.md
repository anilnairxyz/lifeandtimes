# The Mirror Test (for Machines)

**Question:** What would count as machine self-modeling?

<!-- more -->

**Research Abstract:**
Contemporary consciousness research in AI proposes “indicator properties” derived from scientific theories (global workspace, higher-order, recurrent processing, etc.) and evaluates AI systems against them. This gives you a disciplined alternative to vibes-based claims. ([arXiv][12])

**Anchor Refs:**
Butlin et al., “Consciousness in Artificial Intelligence” (2023). ([arXiv][12])

**Story Beat:**
We stop asking “is it conscious?” and start asking “which architectural markers matter?”
