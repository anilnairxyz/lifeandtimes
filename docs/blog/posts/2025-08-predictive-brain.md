# The Predictive Brain

**Question:** Is perception passive reception or active inference?

<!-- more -->

**Research Abstract:**
Predictive processing and the free-energy principle model cognition as minimizing prediction error / surprise through perception and action. This reframes “experience” as controlled model-maintenance under uncertainty. ([Nature][6])

**Anchor Refs:**
Friston, “The free-energy principle” (2010); predictive processing literature. ([Nature][6])

**Story Beat:**
Now we can say what “being in a world” computationally means: continual prediction under constraint.
