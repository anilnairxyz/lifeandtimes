# The Mastery Drive

**Question:** Is thriving reducible to an objective function?

**Research Abstract:**
Flow theory models optimal experience as a balance between challenge and skill, with deep engagement and intrinsic reward. It provides a psychological template for “mastery” that we can later translate into computational analogues (curiosity, empowerment, competence gradients).

**Anchor Refs:**
Csikszentmihalyi, *Flow* (1990).

**Story Beat:**
We end Part III with the unsettling possibility: to build robust agency, we may need to build systems that can truly lose.
