# The Social Synapse

**Question:** Is intelligence fundamentally social?

<!-- more -->

**Research Abstract:**
The social brain hypothesis argues that primate brain expansion is tightly linked to managing complex social relationships. For AGI, multi-agent interaction and social feedback may be core to developing norms, self-concepts, and person-like behavior. ([Wiley Online Library][13])

**Anchor Refs:**
Dunbar, “The Social Brain Hypothesis” (1998). ([Wiley Online Library][13])

**Story Beat:**
Alone, the system is an optimizer; among others, it becomes a participant.
