**Research Abstract:**
Reinforcement learning formalizes reward-driven policy optimization; intrinsic motivation and self-determination theory address internally generated motives and autonomy/competence/relatedness as drivers of sustained agency. ([selfdeterminationtheory.org][10])

Deci & Ryan (1985); Ryan & Deci (2000). ([selfdeterminationtheory.org][10])
