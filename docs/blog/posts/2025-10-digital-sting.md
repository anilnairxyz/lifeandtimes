# The Digital Sting

**Question:** Can we build “pain” as more than a negative number?

<!-- more -->

**Research Abstract:**
Affective computing studies computational representations of emotion and affect in interaction. The hard question is whether synthetic “valence” can be architected as intrinsic urgency rather than externally imposed scoring.

**Anchor Refs:**
Picard, *Affective Computing* (1997).

**Story Beat:**
We begin flirting with the thing that makes morality unavoidable: engineered suffering.
