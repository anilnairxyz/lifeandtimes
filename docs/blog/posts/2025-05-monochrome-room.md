# The Monochrome Room

**Question:** If a system has complete descriptions, what could still be missing?

<!-- more -->

**Research Abstract:**
The knowledge argument isolates a gap between **physical description** and **phenomenal acquaintance**. Even if one rejects non-physical qualia, the thought experiment usefully distinguishes *propositional knowledge* from *knowing-what-it’s-like*.

**Anchor Refs:**
Jackson, “Epiphenomenal Qualia” (1982).

**Story Beat:**
We discover that “complete description” may still fail to deliver “lived understanding.”
