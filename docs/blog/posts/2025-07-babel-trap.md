# The Babel Trap

**Question:** If our world is learned through language, whose world is it?

<!-- more -->

**Research Abstract:**
Language can scaffold thought but also constrain it: a system trained on human descriptions inherits human ontologies, biases, and blind spots. The philosophical pressure here is that meaning is use-bound and socially embedded (Wittgenstein-style), not merely encoded. (Use Wittgenstein as a conceptual hinge.)

**Anchor Refs:**
Wittgenstein, *Philosophical Investigations* (1953) (conceptual anchor).

**Story Beat:**
We end Part I realising: representation is not enough—something must *situate* it.
