# The Recursive Self

**Question:** What changes when a system can improve itself?

<!-- more -->

**Research Abstract:**
Recursive self-improvement and “intelligence explosion” arguments focus on capability discontinuities and control problems. Whether or not one buys the strongest versions, the safety implication is clear: systems that can rewrite goals, tools, and cognition challenge governance. ([philpapers.org][14])

**Anchor Refs:**
Bostrom, *Superintelligence* (2014). ([philpapers.org][14])

**Story Beat:**
The created becomes a strategic actor—and the human role shifts from designer to negotiator.
