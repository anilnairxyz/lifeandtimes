# The Price of a Pulse

**Question:** If the “brain” doesn’t pay, how does it learn to care?

<!-- more -->

**Research Abstract:**
This is the “skin in the game” problem in technical clothing: risk and cost must be endogenous to decision-making, otherwise incentives can be gamed or externalised. (You can connect here to safety failures, reward hacking, and specification gaming.)

**Anchor Refs:**
Use “skin in the game” as conceptual anchor; connect to alignment discourse.

**Story Beat:**
We see that disjoint embodiment creates shallow stakes.
