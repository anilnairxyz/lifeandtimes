# The Hunger for Equilibrium

**Question:** Why do living systems act at all?

<!-- more -->

**Research Abstract:**
Homeostasis (and broader allostasis) frame life as maintaining viability under perturbation. Damasio’s work links feelings to homeostatic regulation and the emergence of value.

**Anchor Refs:**
Damasio, *The Strange Order of Things*

**Story Beat:**
We discover “needs” are not preferences; instead, they are existential constraints.
