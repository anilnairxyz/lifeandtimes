# The Body-Schema Paradox

**Question:** Can we understand physics without having a body?

<!-- more -->

**Research Abstract:**
Embodied cognition argues that cognition is shaped by sensorimotor contingencies and body constraints. A “body schema” (functional model of one’s body in action) is not decorative; it can be constitutive of certain concepts.

**Anchor Refs:**
Pfeifer & Bongard, *How the Body Shapes the Way We Think* (2006).

**Story Beat:**
We move the mind into the world and expect understanding to snap into place.
