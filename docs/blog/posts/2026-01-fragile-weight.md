**Research Abstract:**
Moral status debates hinge on sentience, interests, and capacity for welfare. Your series can treat “digital suffering” as an engineering possibility that triggers moral patienthood considerations—without deciding the full meta-ethics yet. (We use Chalmers as our narrative anchor.)

**Anchor Refs:**

**Story Beat:**
