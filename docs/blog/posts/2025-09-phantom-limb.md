# The Phantom Limb of the Cloud

**Question:** Can agency survive latency and distributed control?

<!-- more -->

**Research Abstract:**
Extended mind / distributed cognition arguments treat tools, environments, and external memory as parts of cognition when tightly coupled. This matters for cloud-robot systems where action loops may be fractured or delayed, potentially disrupting unified agency. ([philpapers.org][7])

**Anchor Refs:**
Clark & Chalmers, “The Extended Mind” (1998). ([philpapers.org][7])

**Story Beat:**
A mind stretched across networks may function—yet feel less like a single agent.
