# The Chronos Problem

**Question:** Without continuous time and memory, can there be a persisting self?

<!-- more -->

**Research Abstract:**
Cognitive science treats episodic/autobiographical memory as central to identity and self-continuity. Machine learning adds a technical analogue: continual learning under distribution shift and catastrophic forgetting. (Use this chapter to connect “self” to *time-binding*.)

**Anchor Refs:**
Autobiographical memory research (Conway as your narrative anchor).

**Story Beat:**
We end Part II with a sharper gap: embodiment and prediction help, but do not yet produce *necessity*.
